# Auto Clicker
I grew tired of getting licenced wall by auto clickers when I only needed something simple to just click

Made this application in a couple of minutes, so feel free to download the source code and compile it for yourself

Compilation instructions:
1) Download python compiler
2) Create the environment variables for Scripts folder (to use PIP)
3) Run "pip install keyboard" on any console
4) Run "pip install pyinstaller" on any admin console
5) From the folder with the source code run: "pyinstaller -F autoclicker.py". Optional: use the -i parameter to add the icon!
6) Enjoy!

Otherwise feel free to download the Windows compiled version here: https://github.com/clodan/RandomCoding/releases/tag/1.0

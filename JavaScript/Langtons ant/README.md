# P5 Library

This example works with P5 Library! Make sure to add it to the path /p5/ before starting the example

## Variables

On the sketch.js you can change _WIDTH and _HEIGHT for any values you want, but do be warned that the columns and rows needs to reflect the grid values as for them to be square as well.

cols and rows can be changes for any square style values suck as 10 x 10 (higher values make the algorithm be more entertaining though). I wouldnt go above 200-ish though.

_FPS can be changed to speed up or slow down processing

_ANTOFFSET can be used to center the ant within the square for some high resolution takes

_FASTMODE can be used to process very high speed iterations of the algorithm

_FASTLOOPS can be used with _FASTMODE to set the amount of iterations per frame that the algorithm will draw and move the ant
